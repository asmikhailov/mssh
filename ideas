Object. CLI SSH Manager
Ideas:
Store connections
Store keys (private and public)
Store credentials
Store connections in tree-like structure
Command-line completition (?)
Encrypt database
Works with system wide ssh-manager and keygen-software(putty?)
PL - Golang?
Initial store is pretty simple. Advanced edit on specified command.
Works over command line/shell?
Tabbed interface (screen-like)
Search connection by name, IP, desc, etc
